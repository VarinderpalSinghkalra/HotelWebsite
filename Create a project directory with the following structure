To build a two-tier hotel website with Python, you'll typically use a web framework like Flask or Django. Flask is lightweight and straightforward for simpler projects, while Django is more feature-rich and suitable for larger projects.

Here’s a basic example of how you can set up a two-tier hotel website using Flask. The two tiers will include:

Front-end: The user interface where visitors can view hotel details and make reservations.
Back-end: The admin interface where the hotel staff can manage room availability and reservations.
1. Setting Up the Project Structure

Create a project directory with the following structure:
hotel_website/
├── app.py
├── templates/
│   ├── home.html
│   ├── admin.html
│   ├── room_details.html
│   └── layout.html
└── static/
    ├── style.css
    └── images/
